Me and My Unicorn,
both of us are stubborn;
we are a little strange,
And wonder into the mountains range;

We play and Jump to touch the clouds,
but miss our hold and fall on the ground;

I lay mute and delighted fill with melody,
when I heard a mysterious sound of my buddy;

I woke up with a flash of light,
the melody had ceased and the day was bright!!
Ohh! what a strange dream last night!!!!!!

I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
and twinkle on the Milky Way,
They stretched in never-ending line
along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not be but gay,
in such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
what wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow;
And everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go.
 
He followed, her to school one day;
That was against the rule;
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school.
